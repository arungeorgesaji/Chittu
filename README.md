# Chittu

## Purpose
Chittu aims to create a virtual assistant capable of understanding and responding to user queries effectively. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning to provide intelligent responses to various questions,it can also perform various tasks to aid the user.

## Features
- **Natural Language Understanding**: The assistant can understand natural language queries using tokenization and lemmatization techniques.
- **Classification**: It classifies user queries into predefined categories using a neural network model.
- **Response Generation**: Based on the classification, the assistant generates appropriate responses to interact with users effectively.
- **Training**: The project includes a training script that allows for continuous improvement of the assistant's understanding and responses.
- **Extensibility**: The project can be extended to support additional intents and improve the assistant's capabilities over time.

## Purpose
Chittu aims to create a virtual assistant capable of understanding and responding to user queries effectively. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning to provide intelligent responses to various commands and questions.

## Features
- **Natural Language Understanding**: The assistant can understand natural language queries using tokenization and lemmatization techniques.
- **Classification**: It classifies user queries into predefined categories using a neural network model.
- **Response Generation**: Based on the classification, the assistant generates appropriate responses to interact with users effectively.
- **Training**: The project includes a training script that allows for continuous improvement of the assistant's understanding and responses.
- **Extensibility**: The project can be extended to support additional intents and improve the assistant's capabilities over time.

## Functionality
The AI assistant supports the following functions:
- **Wikipedia Search**: Retrieve information from Wikipedia.
- **Time**: Get the current time.
- **Repeat My Words**: Repeat what the user says.
- **News**: Fetch the latest news headlines.
- **Weather**: Get the current weather conditions.
- **Open App/Web**: Open specified applications or websites.
- **Close App/Web**: Close specified applications or websites.
- **YouTube Search**: Search YouTube for videos.
- **Google Search**: Perform a Google search.
- **Tired**: Respond when the user is tired.
- **Internet Speed**: Check the internet speed.
- **Video Game**: Play a video game.
- **Search Pokémon**: Search for information about Pokémon.
- **Generate Password**: Generate a random password.
- **Sleep**: Put the assistant to sleep.
- **CPU Temperature**: Check the CPU temperature.
- **Guess Number Game**: Play a number guessing game.
- **WhatsApp Later**: Schedule a WhatsApp message.
- **Audiobook**: Listen to an audiobook.
- **Disturb**: Disturb the user.
- **Download**: Download a file.
- **Brightness**: Adjust screen brightness.
- **Chat**: Engage in a chat conversation.

## Usage
1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed along with required libraries such as `numpy`, `nltk`, and `tensorflow`.
   
2. **Data Preparation**: Edit the  JSON file (`intents.json`) containing intents and corresponding patterns for training the assistant according to your needs.

3. **Training**: Run the training script (`main.py`) to train the neural network model using the provided intents data.

4. **Interacting with the Assistant**: Once trained, you can interact with the assistant by running the main script (`chittu.py`). It will listen for user queries and provide responses based on the trained model.

## Files
- **intents.json**: Contains intents and patterns for training the assistant.
- **main.py**: Training script for the neural network model.
- **chittu.py**: Main script for interacting with the trained assistant and also you the other functions available.

## Getting Started
To get started with the AI Assistant project:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies using `pip`.
- Prepare the intents data in JSON format.
- Train the model using the provided training script.
- Run the main script to interact with the assistant.
